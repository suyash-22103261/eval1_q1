# eval1_q1
#Write a program (C/C++) that reads coefficients of a polynomial (up to the 5th degree) from the user, calculates its derivative, and prints the resulting polynomial. Ensure that the program handles different degrees of polynomials (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic). Initialize a new Git repository for this project, commit the code, and upload it to your GitHub account. Provide the URL of the repository.
